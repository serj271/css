	This paragraph does <em>not</em> establish a containing block for any of
	its descendant elements that are absolutely positioned. Therefore, the
	absolutely positioned <b>boldface</b> element it contains will be
	positioned with respect to the initial containing block.
	</p>
	<p class="contain">
	Thanks to <code>position: relative</code>, this paragraph establishes a
	containing block for any of its descendant elements that are absolutely
	positioned. Since there is such an element-- <em>that is to say, <b>a
	boldfaced element that is absolutely positioned,</b> placed with respect
	to its containing block (the paragraph)</em>, it will appear within the
	element box generated by the paragraph.

	When we consider the effect of positioning, it quickly becomes clear that
	authors can do a great deal of damage to layout, just as they can do very
	interesting things.<span style="position: absolute; top: auto;
	left: 0;">[4]</span> This is usually the case with useful technologies:
	the sword always has at least two edges, both of them sharp.
