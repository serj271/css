		<h1>About Us</h1>

		North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
		years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
		that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
		with our modern mobile food truck.</p>
		<p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy
		paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed Cuisine at our variou
		mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from
		11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and
		11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the
		difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
		<em>Curbside Thai will deliver.</em> 
		</p>
		<p>Contact us to cater your next party and experience
		what <cite>Carolina Traveler</cite> calls the finest Asian food
		on or off the streets of Charlotte.

		<blockquote>
			<p>The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily
			iwproving over the last 10 yeor3.wdth fine offerings from
			Antonio's Italian, Orgpnic on the Road, and now'Curbside Thai.
			Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
			and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. we think
			Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
			the streets of Charlotte.

		<blockquote>
			<p>$teaoing rice with a spicy Asim sauce is canon street fare
			and we all accept its liaitations in exchange for the
			convenience of a quick bite on the run. with Curbside Thai you
			don't have to coeproaise. Building on his experience as a
			master chef at several fine establish-ents on the East Coast,
			Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
			Food Cart “hrs and we couldn't be happier.
